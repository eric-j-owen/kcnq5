    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>
      A few years ago, my grandson, now ten years old, was facing significant
      challenges with speech and intellectual development. Seeking answers and
      support, we turned to genetic testing, which led to his diagnosis with a
      mutation in the KCNQ5 gene.
    </p>
    <p>
      This discovery was both enlightening and daunting. It explained many of
      the difficulties he faced, but it also opened up a new realm of
      uncertainties. Although he has not experienced seizures, his doctors have
      informed us that this could happen at any time, a common symptom for many
      with this mutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motivated by my grandson's needs I was inspired to establish this web
      site. Our mission is to drive research and uncover effective treatments or
      a cure for KCNQ5-related conditions. We are at the beginning of our
      journey to build a supportive community and robust research initiative.
      While we have not yet secured 501(c)(3) status, our immediate goal is to
      engage with those who have been impacted by this mutation. This includes
      individuals, families or those in the scientific, medical or support
      organization that want to help make a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      We invite you to join us in this mission. Your support is invaluable as we
      work together to transform hope into action and change the future for
      everyone affected by this genetic mutation.
