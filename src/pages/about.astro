    <h1>What is KCNQ5?</h1>
    <p>
      The KCNQ5 gene plays a role in the functioning of potassium channels in
      the brain, which are crucial for the regulation of neuronal excitability
      and keeping the electrical activity in your brain and other parts of your
      nervous system running smoothly. Mutations in this gene can disrupt the
      communication between neurons, leading to various neurological issues,
      such as intellectual disabilities, muscle coordination problems, or even
      seizures, depending on how the channels are affected.
    </p>
    <p>The KCNQ5 gene is also known by several aliases, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>KV7.5</li>
      <li>Voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv7.5</li>
      <li>Potassium voltage-gated channel, subfamily KQT, member 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These aliases reflect its function and its classification within the
      family of voltage-gated potassium channels. Continued scientific
      investigation is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms by which
      KCNQ5 mutations cause neurological conditions and to develop effective
      drug or gene therapies. This includes studies to explore the potential for
      correcting the genetic mutations directly or developing therapies that can
      mitigate the impact of these mutations on brain function. As research in
      this field progresses, it may offer new hope for targeted treatments or
      gene therapy approaches in the future.
